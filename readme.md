# Tip Calculator

The Tip Calculator allows the user to insert the amount of dollar spent on a bill and calculate the fixed tip amounts accordingly.
After the calculation it shows how much each individual is owed including the said tip. The custom field input does not yet work, this is a work in progress.

## Front-end Mentor

This exercise was a challenge on frontendmentor.io which shows the design template in different screen sizes, active states etc.
It also includes the .json data and image files, but apart from that I had to figure out how to make it work myself.
This project is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
